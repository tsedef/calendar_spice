## Architecture
```
Plan" on using Redux for UI-related state, UserAuth, App config, navigation state, cached data (to avoid redundant api calls)
RxJS: complex async operations, event handling (e.g.:User interactions. manage event streams and react to them)
    -- data transformation, real-time data updates(prob api-driven), custom data processing pipelines"
```
